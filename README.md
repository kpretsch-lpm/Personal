<B>Manger README</B>

Hi. I’m in the technology leadership team at Leslie’s Pools. I have worked to create the Co-pilots guide to working with me and for me. I want to give credit where it is due, this idea for me spawned from David Ayers, VP of Engineering at Invitation Homes @iamagiantnerd, who heard about it from other experts. I am passionate about becoming better and making those around me better. I’m a fan of sharing stores of failure for purposes growth @fuckupnights; this guide will help you have a marvelous experience working with me.
What you should get from this? You should feel like you know me a little better, know how I think and know what I value. You can hold me accountable to it – so I update my behavior (or my document). 

<B>My Job:</B>

1. How Leslie’s defines my job

My job is to increase the shareholder value of the company, which means protecting the existing shareholder value. (It’s really exciting and empowering to be able to do this)

The actual description is longer, but I’m empowered to do everything in my power to immediately, consistently and provide for best climb.

2. How my boss defines my/his job

Empowering me to raise value as quickly as possible with the added expectation I communicate to him precisely what is going on so he can communicate the decision points upward.

I have added a personal expectation of keeping my boss safe, and I ask that you do the same to me – it grows an intense loyalty in both directions.

3. The real world stuff

My job is to grow a team of makers and ensure that we always take a certain number of steps forward for every step back, and that the proportion is always right. I am expected to do this as quickly as possible for short term and long term growth. 

It means I constantly remind teams of value, push them to move faster, and encourage them to look at their work. Every question I ask is intensely focused on risk, time and value (in other words, they are always hard – you should never expect an easy question - its not my job). 

What’s important to know is I am not much of a maker anymore, I’m a communicator, decision maker/recommender and coach. I can’t make things without makers. (That’s likely you or your team) 

4. How I do it?

I try to provide you context as to why we do what we do.

I make you move faster, by making you feel comfortable. This comes in a variety of ways, but usually by empowering you to focus on the value adds, and how to reduce fear or making waiting feel less comfortable than moving). I will jump in any ditch with you, the reason I’m in my role is because I’ve found my way out of that same ditch a few times already.

I am not afraid to mop floors, therefore I’m not scared to look at code either.

<B>How I approach my job (and everything):</B>

At the point you’ve been hired (congratulations), the burden of your success has shifted from you, to me. In the worst employment situations I’ve either hired wrong or motivated wrong – which are both “me issues”. I take this seriously. You’ve made a life decision to be here, and I take my burden to ensure that was not a mistake that you apologize to your family for. Work should make you stronger personally and professionally, I lead so that your significant other says “our life has improved since you joined Leslie’s”. That means, every struggle we have is not a question if we want you on the team, I want you to be successful because I take ownership of that decision.

The world is binary and mathematical to me. I often receive the feedback I don’t think like other people, and that’s why I write this. I break every decision into an equation of value, risk, reward and probability. This isn’t an emotional process, therefore don’t receive my opinions/decisions as emotional.

I am naturally an internal communicator, who likes time and to think through the issue (I’m challenging myself to be a more external processor). This means I want the deck the night before, to read, and provide feedback. (I call these Airplane Ready: I should be able to read them alone and understand the key points without being previously familiar)

I am a believer in radical candor and I think and write in a monotone voice. I ask tough questions all the time, but I do it without emotion. Thus, please hear them in monochrome. I identify future opportunities in everything we do, that doesn’t mean I’m disappointed in what we’ve already done.

I fail every day, and I hit the reset button and start over. There are some rough meetings out there – no one enjoys it when we miss the mark. You hit the reset button and try again. I encourage you to find your reset button. Working with a person who believes in radical candor doesn’t mean you ignore tough feedback, it means you come in ready to hit the reset button and try to apply it.

<b>You Problems vs. Me Problems</B> 

If you own the problem/opportunity/challenge it is what I call a “you” problem. I let you own it, and more specifically, I let you own solving it. I let you also own asking for help (and who you ask). I ask that you know when to ask for help if you want it to be an “us” problem. I will ALWAYS jump in the ditch with you and navigate the way out of it and I resist solving a problem you own (as a means to protect my time and your autonomy) unless you ask for it, at which point I’m all in. 

I don’t hesitate to help the moment you ask, as my job is to ensure your success. It doesn’t reflect poorly on you to ask for help. You will hear me refer to that as a “you” problem if you are waiting for me to solve it for you or not taking initiative.
There are also “Me” problems, and I take these seriously. I owe the team the same transparency as to what I’m dealing with and if I need your help, I will ask you for help. 

My favorite successes have been “us” problems, when someone needs my help. My worst failures have been “me” problems caused by a “You” problem that festered and surprised us. Asking doesn’t hurt you, not asking and it becoming a me problem later does reflect poorly.

<B>What I value?</b>

I think about traits I value like currency – if I take a $1 USD to Canada, it will go farther than other locations. All good traits are good, but there are traits I value that go farther to our strategy.

Hard Work. I do not believe I’m the smartest person, but if I’m 75% as intelligent and I work 50% more, than I’ll end up 25% ahead. I believe one of the largest value drivers of time to market, is time worked.

Intelligent Approach/Pragmatism. You’ll see that I try to prioritize my work in a key order, and align my time. I admire processes that do the same. There is more than enough work and problems, how do you order them? Slot your goal commitments aggressively but logically.

Root Cause. Everything we do needs quick symptom resolution, but are you tracking the root cause? A firefighter without a fire prevention strategy is a player vs. a captain.

Belly Laughs. I think a constant smile is nice, but I’ll take a gritty day with a good belly laugh. I encourage you to make your team laugh daily, and make me laugh. There is bullshit out there, find a good laugh, it will help you retain your teams, and help me when I need it.

<b>How you should approach your job?</B>
1.	You should talk to your team and know everything about what is going on in their world. I can’t do that (i.e. have 50 direct reports, but I desperately want to because I care about the team and believe showing it creates retention – that’s why you’re here, to create that)
2.	Be able to change when presented with feedback or an ask
3.	Be willing to tell me what you believe is good and bad, what we should be working on (and why it is most important) and what you’ve deferred (and why it is least important)
4.	I can manage my time, if you avoid your boss because he’s busy, you’re preventing me from providing assistance. If you need help, communicate and I’ll handle how to schedule around it.
5.	Try to match my aggressiveness, and try to share that with your teams. Our value as a team is being able to create value quickly.
6.	Don’t be idealistic by nature of idealism, provide visibility to the different approaches and the pros and con’s of each.
7.	Be willing to share a recommendation and rationale even if it is not accepted. (You can’t say I told you so if you never told me)

<b>How I measure performance?</b>

I’ve been candid I work in numbers, and I believe they protect all employees. If you identify the goals you have and how you want to be measured, you communicate them and you hit them you cannot receive overall negative feedback. If you think you’re awesome and think you’re doing a good job, you’re at risk that other people don’t “feel” that or don’t exposure to why they should.

If you have numbers, you can constantly know where you stand vs. hoping I think positively of the things you do that I can’t see. Keep in mind, I don’t see what you do all day so if you work really hard to make it look easy it will show in your numbers but not in my qualitative review.

An example of this: Pick 5 goals, identify the baseline and identify your goal.

If you manage Developers – it can be commits, features, conversion and critical defects. What are you at today? Where will you be in 1 quarter?
If you manage QA – It is functional test bank, % automation, hours manual vs. automated, total quality hours of QA and critical defects.
If you manage the PMO – It is budget, timeline delivery.
The numbers don’t lie, and if you miss the numbers, you can depend on me to try and see the other side but if you have numbers it isn’t dependent to lean on my feelings.

<b>Dignity</B>

I’ve been blessed in my career to work with a multi-cultural team. It has been an incredible personal journey of growth and honestly my ability to build relationships with people of all identities has been one of the most powerful personal experiences. I believe in a workplace that makes people stronger at home. To that end, I’ve managed team members and direct reports going through huge life questions and transitions, this includes gender identity, marriage, divorce, sexuality, family strife and death. In those times of severe stress, things may not feel good at home, you may not know who you are or question how other people see you. You will never feel that at work and during those times it can be your shelter. You are valued and you can be successful here regardless of any of those factors.
To this end, I believe people are treated with dignity at all times. We can say what we think about issues, opinions, we can argue, we can be passionate, we can have performance issues, we can yell, but as human beings we treat others with dignity and don’t take shots at peoples identity. The exact moment you don’t do that – you don’t work for me. It will be swift and instantaneous. We don’t lead a team where we don’t care about your identifying characteristics and personal struggles. All people are worthy of dignity here. This is the only non-negotiable. No shots on the things that make us all “people”.

<b>Crimes I’m guilty of:</B>

•	I am willing to get my hands dirty, go directly to the point of the question, miss a communication link, etc. Don’t be offended, I didn’t go around you I went straight to the source. If you fell out of the loop, ask me to get you back in it, because I want you in that.

•	I blurt the answer when I know it, and I’m somewhat over confident in it. If you have a natural course to figure things out I may ruin it. Do NOT resist saying your opinion anyways or correct me. Seriously, if I stated my opinion early, don’t be scared to counter or tell me you disagree. If I ask, and you tell me you agree when you don’t you hurt us.

•	I sometimes come across that everyone should have my opinion. If I act like this – tell me what the other side may think. I need the reminder.

•	When people outside our team don’t choose the right thing, I tend to get worked up – even if the end result doesn’t matter - I don’t know why they didn’t choose the right answer. I ignore the diminishing value in the differences between approaches, obsessed with what they didn’t consider when they decided that. I can be reminded to say “oh well, it is what it is”.

<b>How We Win:</B>

1. Reducing downtime of critical systems (responding quickly to fuck-up’s)
2. Be curious and have ideas – if someone gave you a design missing something – suggest an improvement and maybe even just go for it and we’ll tell them about it during UAT.
3. You can exceed a ticket by 20% if you see an opportunity – otherwise ticket it as a future improvement. MVP MVP MVP. Don’t refactor our code base every change or re-write it your way – accomplish the ticket.
4. Move quickly – see an issue – set up the meeting the next day. If the meeting is scheduled next week, why not schedule it today?

<b>Personal:</B>
I live in Los Angeles, and commute to Phoenix. I go to the gym daily. I love to fly airplanes. I will work late and early to make sure I get you into my schedule.
